The men of the tribe left several years ago to fight in the war 
against the Fire Nation, leaving the women and children to fend for themselves 
until they return. Although they are subsisting, there is the lingering threat
of Fire Nation troops showing up at any time; against which they would be 
completely defenseless. Luckily, the Fire Nation has little reason to do so;
the location is very remote and has no military or strategic significance.
